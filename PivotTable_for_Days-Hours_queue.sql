/*
Pivot tables are not widely used in SQL, despite being useful for interpreting results. So there are no built-in functions to do this for us. 
Sometimes the dataset is just so massive that it is the only option.
For rows, we will use the hour of the day in that nice format, and then make each column a different day!
To filter a row we use WHERE, but using CASE() in SELECT can filter columns. We can use a CASE() function for each day to separate the queue time column into a column for each day. Letâ€™s begin by only focusing on Sunday. 
So, when a row's DAYNAME(time_of_record) is Sunday, we make that value equal to time_in_queue, and NULL for any days.
We create separate columns for each day with a CASE() function.
